# Working-with-APIs

This repo shows to how to fetch API's using the fetch() keyword and the then() method.

## Description
There are 4 parts to this file, i.e catFact.html, catFact.js, index.html and index.js 

The First API calls were from the Hacker-news URL below  which is pointing to my index files and the data gotten from this API call includes the news title, the type and the name of the author.

```

```

The Second API call is the solution to the assignment written in comments at the end of the index.js file, the goal of the assignment is to get data about cat facts that is to be displayed to the browser every 5 seconds acheived by setInterval(). the URL is written below
